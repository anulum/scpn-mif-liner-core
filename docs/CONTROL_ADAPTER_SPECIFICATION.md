SCPN MIF Liner Core — CONTROL adapter specification

# CONTROL adapter specification

**Adapter identifier:** `scpn-mif-liner-core.control-adapter`

**Contract version:** `0.1.0-spec` (specification only — **no implementation
exists**)
**Consumer:** `SCPN-CONTROL` plugin protocol

This document is the device-owned contract through which a future
material-liner MIF adapter would supply device truth to the SCPN control
plane. Publishing this specification creates no capability and no claim: an
implementation may appear only with the replay fixtures and evidence the
reactor family standard requires for `control_research_ready`, and it
enters CONTROL only through CONTROL's installed public contract with
real-surface tests.

## Authority model (non-negotiable semantics)

1. The adapter **supplies declarations and observations; it never
   actuates**. It exposes no verb that writes to plant hardware.
2. `SCPN-CONTROL` alone admits observations and forms `ControlAction`
   values. The adapter cannot construct, forward, or replay a
   `ControlAction`.
3. SPO semantic output consumed alongside adapter data is `review_only`
   (`actionable = false`); the adapter must not re-label it.
4. Independent machine protection retains the final veto on every plant
   path. The adapter declares the safety envelope; it does not implement
   protection.
5. Every adapter payload carries provenance (source, clock identity,
   contract version); CONTROL rejects payloads without it.

## Contract surfaces

### 1. Observation schema (device → CONTROL)

Declared per diagnostic channel:

- channel identifier and physical quantity with SI unit — including
  drive-array synchronisation monitors, liner-trajectory and cavity-shape
  channels, target-compression channels, burn channels (yield, peak-
  compression timing anchor), and thermal-cycle channels for the liquid
  variant, with exact definitions declared;
- coordinate convention (liner-cavity frame, drive-array element label)
  and spatial layout (scalar, array, or image-derived);
- sampling clock identity and timestamp semantics (millisecond-class
  compression and microsecond-class burn time bases declared
  separately);
- uncertainty representation (declared per channel; absent uncertainty is
  an explicit `unquantified` marker, never an implied zero);
- validity and quality flags with fail-closed semantics.

### 2. State schema (device → CONTROL)

- shot lifecycle phase (`liner_formation`, `target_injection`,
  `compression`, `burn_window`, `expansion_recovery`, `thermal_cycle`,
  `terminated`) with monotonic transition semantics and device-truth
  event records for synchronisation faults and interface-instability
  growth;
- configuration identity: the `mechanical_or_liquid_liner_mif` registry
  configuration, the liner/driver class revision, and the configuration
  policy revision that produced the shot;
- device availability state for control research (simulation, replay, HIL;
  live plant states are out of scope for this contract version).

### 3. Actuator-capability declaration (device → CONTROL)

For each actuator class (drive-array synchronisation programming, vortex
spin-up or pusher-reset systems, target-injection systems, heat-extraction
loop declarations):

- declared capability envelope (bounds, slew limits, latency class) as
  device truth for CONTROL's admission checks — the millisecond
  compression timescale makes this family the portfolio's nearest case
  for future intra-shot supervisory research, which nevertheless remains
  outside this contract version;
- explicit marker `direct_actuation: false` — the declaration describes
  what the plant could accept from a certified path; it is not a command
  surface and the adapter provides no command transport.

### 4. Safety-envelope declaration (device → CONTROL and protection review)

- machine-readable operational envelope (drive energy and synchronisation
  tolerances, liner integrity and splash bounds, thermal-cycle limits
  with applicability domains);
- declared device-level hazard semantics for synchronisation faults,
  interface mixing, and liner failure;
- statement of the independent machine-protection boundary this envelope
  is subordinate to.

### 5. Replay fixtures contract (evidence)

An implementation must ship replay fixtures that exercise every schema
above through CONTROL's real admission path: nominal compression cycles,
desynchronised and interface-unstable sequences, boundary-of-envelope
cases, invalid-payload rejections, and clock-mismatch rejections. Fixtures
are versioned with the adapter and their digests recorded; HIL evidence is
additionally required before `control_research_ready` may be declared.

## Versioning rules

- `0.x` specification versions may change with a recorded revision note in
  this file and a manifest update in the same commit.
- From the first implemented `1.0.0`, changes follow semantic
  compatibility: breaking schema changes require a major version, a
  translation path or governed deprecation, and re-run producer/consumer
  evidence on both sides.
- The manifest (`reactor-domain.json` → `control_adapter`) always records
  the exact contract version; validator and drift checks keep the two
  files in agreement.
